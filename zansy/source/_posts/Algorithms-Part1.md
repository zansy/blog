# Union-Find

- Apply the union-find data type to solve problems in science, engineering, and industry.
- Define the union-find (or disjoint sets) data type.
- Compare the performance of different algorithms for the union-find data type.
- Design different algorithms (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, path compression) for the union-find data type.
- Develop Java implementations of different algorithms for the union-find data type.
- Use the parent-link representation to represent tree data structures.

## Quick Find
 - an algorithm for solving *the dynamic connectivity problem*, called **Quick-find**. 

- Data structure: 
  - Integer array id[] of length N. With each entry equal to its index.
  - Interpretation: p and q are connected iff they have the same id.


![0, 5 and 6 are connected](/images/image-20190608222745616.png)

- **Find**: Check if p and q have the same id.
- **Union**: To merge components containing p and q, <font color = "red">change all entries whose id equals id[p] to id[q]</font>.

### Java implementation: 
```java
public class QuickFindUF{
    private int[] id;
    public QuickFindUF(int N)
    {
        id = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            id[i] = i;
    }
    public boolean connected(int p, int q)
    { return id[p] == id[q]; }
    public void union(int p, int q)
    {
        int pid = id[p];
        int qid = id[q];
        for (int i = 0; i < id.length; i++)
            if (id[i] == pid) id[i] = qid;
    }
}
```
- <font color = 'red'>Quick-find defect</font>:
  - Union too expensive (N array accesses).
  - Trees are flat, but too expensive to keep them flat.

## Quick Union
- Quick Find is too slow for huge problems. **Quick-union** is an alternative.
- Data structure.
  - Integer array id[] of length N.
  - Interpretation: id[i] is parent of i.
  - Root of i is id[id[id[...id[i]...]]].(keep going until it doesn’t change)

![root of 3 is 9](/images/image-20190608224811928.png)
- **Find**. Check if p and q have the same root.
- **Union**. To merge components containing p and q, <font color = 'red'>set the id of p's root to the id of q's root</font>.
### Java implementation
```Java
public class QuickUnionUF {
    private int[] id;
    public QuickUnionUF(int N) {
        id = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) id[i] = i;
    }
    private int root(int i) {
        while (i != id[i]) i = id[i];
        return i;
    }
    public boolean connected(int p, int q) {
        return root(p) == root(q);
    }
    public void union(int p, int q) {
        int i = root(p);
        int j = root(q);
        id[i] = j;
    }
}
```
- <font color = 'red'>Quick-union defect</font>:
  - Trees can get tall.
  - Find too expensive (could be N array accesses).

## Quick-Union Improvements

### Improvement 1: weighting

- Weighted quick-union:
  - Modify quick-union to avoid tall trees.
  - Keep track of size of each tree (number of objects).
  - Balance by linking root of smaller tree to root of larger tree.

![weighted](/images/image-20190619143633671.png)

- **Data structure**: Same as quick-union, but <font color = "red">maintain extra array sz[i] to count number of objects in the tree rooted at i</font>.

- **Find**. Identical to quick-union `return root(p) == root(q);`

- **Union**. Modify quick-union to:

  - Link root of smaller tree to root of larger tree.
  - Update the sz[] array.

  ```java
  int i = root(p);
  int j = root(q);
  if (i == j) return;
  if (sz[i] < sz[j]) { id[i] = j; sz[j] += sz[i]; }
  else { id[j] = i; sz[i] += sz[j]; } 
  ```

  

- **Proposition**. Depth of any node x is at most **lg N**.

### Improvement 2: path compression

- **Quick union with path compression**. Just after computing the root of p, set the id of each examined node to point to that root.

![before](/images/image-20190619163705844.png)

![after](/images/image-20190619163733989.png)

- **Two-pass implementation**: <font color = 'red'>add second loop to root() to set the id[] of each examined node to the root</font>.
- **Simpler one-pass variant**: Make every other node in path point to its<font color = 'red'> grandparent (thereby halving path length)</font>.

```Java
private int root(int i){
  while (i != id[i]){
    id[i] = id[id[i]];
    i = id[i];
  }
  return i;
}
```

- It's amazing fact that was eventually proved by Friedman and Sachs, that *there is no linear time algorithm for the union find problem*. But **weighted quick union with path compression** in practice is close enough that it's going to enable the solution of huge problems.

## Union-find applications

- Percolation: A model for many physical systems:
  - N-by-N grid of sites.
  - Each site is open with probability p (or blocked with probability 1 – p).
  - System percolates <u>iff top and bottom are connected by open sites</u>.

![Percolation](/images/image-20190620022258204.png)

- Monte Carlo simulation:
  - Initialize N-by-N whole grid to be blocked.
  - Declare random sites open until top connected to bottom.
  - Vacancy percentage estimates p*.

- Dynamic connectivity solution to estimate percolation threshold:
  - Create an object for each site and name them 0 to N 2 – 1.
  - Sites are in same component if connected by open sites.
  - Percolates iff any site on bottom row is connected to site on top row. (<font color = 'red'>brute-force algorithm: N<sup>2</sup> calls to connected()</font>)

![check whether an N-by-N system percolates](/images/image-20190620022753355.png)

- UPDATE: **Introduce 2 virtual sites** (and connections to top and bottom). Percolates iff virtual top site is connected to virtual bottom site. (<font color ='red'>efficient algorithm: only 1 call to connected()</font>)

>A. Mark new site as open; connect it to all of its adjacent open sites. (<font color = 'red'>up to 4 calls to union()</font>)
