## INTRODUCTION
Kafka combines three key capabilities so you can implement your use cases for event streaming end-to-end with a single battle-tested solution:

- To publish (write) and subscribe to (read) streams of events, including continuous import/export of your data from other systems.
- To store streams of events durably and reliably for as long as you want.
- To process streams of events as they occur or retrospectively.
